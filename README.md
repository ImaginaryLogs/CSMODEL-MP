  <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

   <p align="justify">The Video Games Industry has been a highly profitable and lucrative industry as of recent years. With a product and industry as reliant on large funding for development as this one, it would be highly valuable to both developers and investors alike to know the several factors that affect Video Game Sales. This project, which utilizes the 2024 Kaggle Video Game Sales Dataset, aims to understand how certain aspects of a video game influence its total sales, including its genre, console, franchise, release date, and even box art. Data cleaning and pre-processing steps such as proper formatting, removing null values, and including franchises per game were performed on the original dataset before creating infographics and forming statistical tests. </p>
   
   <p align="justify">Several notable discoveries about these attributes were found. Certain genres appear more on specific consoles. While specific genres and specific consoles of a game can significantly influence the total sales, specific combinations of a game's genre and console does not significantly affect its sales. Video Games belonging to a larger franchise generally have much higher sales than standalone games. Lastly, while release month and year impact forecasting sales, it is also highly influenced by factors beyond the scope of the dataset.

# Overview

This jupyter notebook explores the dataset in sections in accordance to the given topic flow. 

**Phase 1**:  
This set deals with exploring possible avenues of meaningful relationships that have yet to explore in the dataset. This involves Data Collection, Data Preprocessing and Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis.

**Phase 2**:
This set deals with standardizing the organization of found data as to validate and test said relationships using statistical tools. This invovles Experimental Design, Data Modelling, Statistical Testing, Insight and Inference Generation.

Additionally, an additional phase may be added in the future of quenching curiosity.

**Phase 3**:
This last section tries to predict the value and direction of the dataset set using machine learning - Data Prediction.
